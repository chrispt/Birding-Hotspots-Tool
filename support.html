                        <p>You need a free eBird API key to use this tool. Here's how to get one:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Visit <a href="https://ebird.org/api/keygen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ebird.org/api/keygen</a></li>
                            <li>Sign in with your eBird account (or create one for free)</li>
                            <li>Fill out the short form requesting API access</li>
                            <li>Copy the API key that's generated</li>
                            <li>Paste it into the "eBird API Key" field on the main page</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Your API key is typically issued immediately. Check the "Remember my API key" box to save it for future visits.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes. Your API key is stored only in your browser's local storage on your device. It is never sent to any server except eBird's API when making requests for hotspot data.</p>
                        <p>If you clear your browser data or use a different browser/device, you'll need to enter your API key again.</p>

                        <p>This tool combines data from several free services:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>eBird</strong> (Cornell Lab of Ornithology) - Hotspot locations and bird observation data</li>
                            <li><strong>LocationIQ</strong> - Address geocoding (converting addresses to coordinates)</li>
                            <li><strong>OpenStreetMap</strong> - Map tiles and driving route calculations</li>
                            <li><strong>Open-Meteo</strong> - Weather conditions for birding insights</li>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>No, eBird API keys are for personal use only. Each user should request their own free API key from eBird. Sharing API keys violates eBird's terms of service and could result in the key being revoked.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The tool offers two main search types:</p>
                        <p><strong>Search a Location</strong> - Find birding hotspots or a specific species within a circular radius around a single location. Within this mode, you can choose to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Find Hotspots</strong> - Discover the best birding spots near your location, sorted by species diversity or distance</li>
                            <li><strong>Find a Species</strong> - Search for recent sightings of a specific bird species near your location</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Plan a Route</strong> - Find hotspots along an actual driving path between two locations. This is ideal for road trips where you want to stop at birding spots along the way without going too far off your route.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>This is a limitation of the eBird API. Their hotspot search endpoint only returns results within a 50km radius. For longer distances, consider using the "Plan a Route" feature, which searches along your entire driving path.</p>

                        <p>The species count shows the number of unique bird species observed at that hotspot within your selected "Days to Look Back" period. This is based on observations reported to eBird by citizen scientists.</p>
                        <p>A higher count generally indicates an active, diverse location, but species presence varies by season and conditions.</p>

                        <p>Driving times are calculated using OpenStreetMap's routing service (OSRM). They represent estimated driving times under normal conditions and don't account for real-time traffic.</p>

                        <p>This can happen for several reasons:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Remote area</strong> - Some regions have few or no eBird hotspots. Try increasing the search range.</li>
                            <li><strong>No recent activity</strong> - If "Days to Look Back" is set too low, hotspots without recent observations won't appear. Try increasing it to 30 days.</li>
                            <li><strong>Route too short</strong> - For route planning, very short routes may not have hotspots within your detour distance.</li>

                        <p>Loading times depend on several factors:</p>

                            <li>Number of hotspots in your search area</li>

                        <p>Reducing the search range or "Days to Look Back" can speed up results. The tool shows progress as it loads each hotspot's details.</p>
